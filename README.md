I am desigining a Hexapod, which will serve as a multi-terrain vehicular platform that can be adapted for future projects, such as for creating an autonomous mobile robot or mobile nerf turret. The code which was used to create graphs and determine the required servo angle for a given position (& vice versa) can be found here on this repository. The STL files for all the 3D printed files are also provided.

Visit my portfolio [here](https://hariselva.github.io/Portfolio/) for more information about this and other projects.

## Technologies
* MATLAB R2022b
* SolidWorks 2022

## TODO
- [ ] Complete torque calculations to verify servo specifications meet requirements
- [ ] Modify CAD model, to deal with the impact force on the legs
- [ ] Simulations (i.e. in ROS)
- [ ] Design electronics (i.e. PCB)
- [ ] Make and add CAD models of electronics to the Assembly
- [ ] Build one leg
- [ ] Build a full prototype
- [ ] Add additional sensors (i.e. Ultrasonic sensor, limit switches, etc.)
- [ ] Start moving design into alternate software (likely Fusion360) in preparation for SolidWorks license expiration
- [ ] Find a better battery
- [ ] Design a better cable management system
