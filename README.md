# Hexapod Robot
![Hexapod Walking Animation](../main/Screenshots%20%26%20GIFs/Walking-LargeStep-Isometric.gif)


I am desigining a Hexapod, which will serve as a multi-terrain vehicular platform that can be adapted for future projects, such as for creating an autonomous mobile robot or mobile nerf turret. The code used create 
graphs and determine the required servo angle given a position & vice versa can be found here on this repository. The STL files for all the 3D printed files are also provided here.

More information on this project can be found on my portfolio [here](https://hariselva.github.io/Portfolio/).
